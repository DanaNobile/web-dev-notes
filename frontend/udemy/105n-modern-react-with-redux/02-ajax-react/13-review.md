# Review
* Difference between class-based Components and functional Components
    - class is used whenever we want the concept of `state` in our Component
    - functional Components are used when we have a simple Component that just takes some properties and returns some amount of static JSX
        + Nothing really changes with these, they are always the same
        + functional Components are super light-weight and super fast and very easy to get started with, the amount of code is dramatically less then a class-based Component
* `state`
    - Very confusing
    - Super challenging to understand
    - Old React used `createClass` syntax but now we use class-based syntax
        + createClass() did a more clear job of initializing state because there was a dedicated method for it called `getInitialState`
    - But in a class-based Component we set our state inside a constructor() method, we don't get a special function to do that
        + in this one place (the constructor()) we use `this.state = {}` and then everywhere else (outside the constructor()) we use `this.setState({})`
    - Most important thing to remember with `state` is that whenever we change our state the Component instantly re-renders along with any children this Component contains as well
* Using import statements and export statements
    - Whenever we try to bring in a file that we wrote we give a **relative path reference**
    - Whereas, whenever we import a Library, we just give the name of the Library
* Using callbacks a lot to manipulate data
    - In a React app, we used callbacks twice
    - In Redux we will use callback much less often
* Component level state
    - Both App and SearchBar have their own state
        + We can pass callbacks to change the state
        + We can pass data from the state to other Components
        + But at the end of the day whenever we change SearchBar state using search state, it only triggers a change on SearchBar, it is very localized form of state
        + That will change in Redux
            * React state is more component level
            * Redux state is more application level
