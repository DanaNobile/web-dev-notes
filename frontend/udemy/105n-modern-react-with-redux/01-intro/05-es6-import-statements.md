# ES6 import statements
`index.js`

```
// Create a new Component. This Component should produce some HTML
const App = function () {
  return <div>Hello</div>;
}
// Take this Component's generated HTML and put it on the page (inside the DOM)
React.render(App);
```

## View in browser
* Error: React is not defined
* We are not importing React in our `index.html`

## JavaScript modules
* Encapsulates the idea that all the code we write in separate files is **siloed** or separated from other code we write or other libraries that we install in our project
* Code that we produce in other files will have zero contact with `index.js` unless we explicitly say 'Hey, I want access to that code in that other file over there'

### silo? 
* Meaning, we can't make reference to any variables in that other file
* So if we have another file and we want to access the `App` variable in `index.js` we have no access to it
* React is already installed in our project
    - We installed it as a dependency we **still** have to say 'Hey, I want access to React inside of this file'

## Getting access to React
* We need to somehow go inside our `node_modules` folder and grab the React package and give our `index.js` file access to it
* That's easy to do:

`index.js`

`import React from 'react';`

1. Go find the library called `React` installed in my application as a dependency
2. Go and find that library (_you can see it if you open `node_modules` and scroll to the R's and find `react`_)
3. And save it to the variable `React`
