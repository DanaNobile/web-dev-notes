# Let's get ready to rumble!

All of our code will be written in `index.js` and all the components we'll be creating and we'll import all of the libraries as we need them. We'll import `react`, `reactDOM`, and all others we need

## Create `/src/index.js` (empty file)

## Create `src/components` folder

Add `.gitkeep` so it will stay in git even though it is empty

## Start the server
`$ npm start`

Will open a browser window. It will just be blank

Open `src/index.js` and add:

`alert('yo');`

You will see it shows the alert without a page refresh

You are read to go to the next step!
