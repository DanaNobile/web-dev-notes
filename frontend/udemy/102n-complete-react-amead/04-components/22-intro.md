# Intro to Components
* React uses a component-based architecture
    - React components allow us to break up our code into small reusable chunks
    - Each little piece being a new component
        + Example
            * I may just have a component to render my `Header` of my app
            * A component for a user's profile
            * A footer component 
            * I Could have another form for rendering the user form and handling user interaction when that form is submitted
    - At end of day components will allow us to make our complex apps and make them simple
* Each component is responsible for defining the JSX that should be rendered when that component is used
    - And components can handle any interaction that anything that is rendered
        + You could have a component that renders a button
            * That same component can define what should happen when the button gets clicked

## What we are doing in this section
* Refactor our current application to use this component based architecture
