# Install Git
* Git is the vcs (Version control system) that we use to keep track of our project code
* It will make it easy to:
    - Keep track of the version
    - Back up our code
    - Revert to previous versions of our code
    - Collaborate with other developers

## Get git
### Install git
* Site is `https://git-scm.com`
* Think of Git like a video game
    - When you play a video game you have various save points that you start with when you get to a certain level, git is similar
    - We create "save points" in Git and this will represent our app and all the files as they were at that point in time
    - You need a save point in a video game when you get the the Boss battle, if you didn't have a save point you'd have to start from the beginning always and that wouldn't be a fun game
    - Git gives you a save point that you can revert to if you have a bug or need to go back to another save point at any time

### git version
`$ git --version`

### Install git
* Download from site and install with all defaults
* A better option would be to install with homebrew
* On Windows you check the option to install `git-bash` (we will need that to set up SSH keys)
* Restart the Terminal

`$ git --version` and you should see the latest git version
