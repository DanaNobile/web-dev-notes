# Setup NodeJS and Express
* We want to create a normal NodeJS Express application

## Express Generator
* [Create Express Generator Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)
* It is a tool that scaffolds out a basic node/Express project

### Install Express Generator Globally
`$ npm install express-generator -g`

* Change into your app folder that will hold the app you are building

#### Using Handlebars (.hbs)
* Install using handlebars as the template engine

`$ express . --hbs`

#### Or you can build the Pug (.pug) template
`$ express . --pug`

## Install needed apps with `$ npm install` or `$ yarn install`
* Then you will see our basic structure of files

## Run Server
`$ npm start` and Your app is running and you will see this when you visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
