# Understanding Components
Everything in React is a Component

## What is a Component?
A reusable piece of your website

Think of tags in HTML. **React** lets you build your own tags and you can put information inside these tags and those two things together is a `Component`

Use the **Inspect Element in Chrome** and then from there click the `React` tab and that will show you how **React** sees it and that is `Components` nested inside `Components`

**benefit of using Components** Team members can just work on one Component 

## Parent Component
The main parent Component is the `App` Component. (_Not always but it is a common name for the main Component_)

## What is `state`
All our Components will pull on the same data and any time that data changes all the Components that pull on it will update simultaneously
