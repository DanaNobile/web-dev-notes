# React App Generation
* Setting up is easy
* But understanding what it is doing is hard

## Create react app
* Do a google search for it
* [or use this link](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* This is a very popular tool
* I'll install it as an npm module and use it to create a brand new react project
    - The documentation on this page is fantastic

## Install Create React app globally
`$ sudo npm install -g create-react-app`

* It is a fast install
* It is just a shell of a program used to generate a new project
* When we install the react app it will take a long time because of all the dependencies

## Install our react project
* **important** Make sure you are inside our `server` folder

`$ create-react-app client`

* **important** Very important you call the folder `client`
