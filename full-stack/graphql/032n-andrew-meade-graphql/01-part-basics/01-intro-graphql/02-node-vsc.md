    - Right click action to duplicate files or folders
* GraphQL for VSCode
    - syntax code for Graphql code
* npm

* npm intellesenses
    - better support for npm modules
* Sublime Text Keymap
* Word Count
    - Just counts words in a markdown file

## Electron desktop app for GraphQL Playground
* https://electronjs.org/apps/graphql-playground
* Change config to localhost:4000

    - **note** But I've had performance issues with this app and unsinstalled it because of it was slowing down my computer
