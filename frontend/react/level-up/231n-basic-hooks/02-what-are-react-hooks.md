# What are react hooks?
* Introduced in React version 16.8
* Enable you to use state and other life cycle within a function based component
* Before we called them FSC (Function stateless components), now we can call them "function components" because they now we can use state in our functions and now we can have more control over the life cycle of these components
    - This is possible using `useEffect` which is a `hook`
    - useEffect and other hooks allows us to break out functionality into reusable functions
    - Just like we can break out UI into components we can break out functionality into reusable components aka "hooks"
        + cool examples of hooks
            * We can test if a click is inside a 'div'
            * We can use a hook to access localStorage via a simple function
