# Time to get started!
`$ npx create-react-app team-finder-app`

`$ cd team-finder-app`

`$ yarn start`

* Delete `src` folder
* Create new `src` folder
* Inside create `App.js` and `index.js`
* We'll create all the components
* We'll import all of the libraries as we need them
    - We'll import `react`, `reactDOM`
    - And all others we need as we need them

## Create `src/components` folder
* Add `.gitkeep`
* So it will stay in git even though the folder is empty

## Start the server
`$ npm start`

* Will open a browser window
* It will just be blank

### Open `src/index.js`
* Add the following JavaScript

`console('yo');`

* You won't see anything unless you open the Chrome console
    - `cmd` + `opt` + `j`
* You are read to go to the next step!
