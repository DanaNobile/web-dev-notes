1. clone my repo (fresh)
2. cd into repo and then to both frontend and backend and npm install for both
    Aaron: which prisma am I using?
    Instead of doing directly on prisma, we login to prisma through the terminal
    `$ prisma login`
    We needed to blow up old files that were generated by phil when he did his prisma install
    Those 2 files were: `$ rm -rf datamodel.prisma prisma.yml`
    we blow old git history and start from scratch
    `$ rm -rf .git` in site root
    start new git
    `$ git init`
    phil did a bad thing and did not ignore the .env when he started his git
    This is why the .env is in the backend folder, so remember that even if you add a file to the .gitignore if it was already there it doesn't disappear
    you have to go in and physically remove from the history of git (google on how to this)
from prisma.yml copy endpoint into .env PRISMA_ENDPOINT

and add variable to prisma.yml

endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}

add a secret and comment it out

endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
# secret: ${env: PRISMA_SECRET}

Add hook
`prisma.yml`

```
endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
# secret: ${env:PRISMA_SECRET}
hooks:
  post-deploy:
      - graphql get-schema -p prisma
```

we deploy with `$ prisma deploy`

npm run deploy does same thing because of scripts in backend/package.json

when we add to datamodel.prisma we need to re-run deploy

you only can see prisma backend schema with bear authorization token

we added a user in the playground

we walked through the code that runs the db and yoga server

we ran and received an error, because the user was missing required fields
we grabbed the finished datamodel.prisma from phil's repo and needed to delete this in the beginning to create a fresh server that would create fresh files
now we are using all types in the new datamodel.prisma with phil's complete data types for entire site

Below is the public graphql
GraphQL Playground `http://localhost:4444/` (partial schema)

prisma gives us the private graphql with authorization code (all schema stuff)

now we work on the frontend
point the config.js file to our local graphql localhost:4444

## Remember to run your frontend and backend app
`$ npm run dev` in both `backend` and `frontend`

# update your cloudinary URL -- CreateItem.js (API base url)
const res = await fetch('https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/piplearns/image/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: data,
});

## Mail
`/backend/.env`

```
// MORE CODE
MAIL_HOST="smtp.mailtrap.io"
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USER="usernamegoeshere"
MAIL_PASS="passwordgoeshere"

Add strip
TakeMyMoney.js
Add publick key

Add Super Secret strip key to .env

Then we went to prisma and added 1 server for postgres
and added another server for production
make sure they are healthy and now we need to deploy

`$ npm run deploy -- -n`

deploy notes

git subtree push --prefix backend heroku-backend master

### Deploy Data Model to the Prisma server
* That is running on `prisma.io` (in backend)

`$ prisma deploy`

2. Update the environment files
3. Update YML
4. Prisma?
5. Stripe
6. Heroku
