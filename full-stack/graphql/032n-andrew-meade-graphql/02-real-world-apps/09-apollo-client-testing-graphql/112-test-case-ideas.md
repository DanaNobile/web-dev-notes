# Test Case Ideas
* Will learn how to internact with your GraphQL API from outside of GraphQL Playground
    - This will allow us to do 2 things:
        1. We can access our API from the browser
            * fetch a list of posts using client side JavaScript
            * Render those to the screen so a user can read them
            * Once we know how to do that we'll need everything we need in order to create a client side for our GraphQL apps
        2. How to set up an automated test suite for our GraphQL applications
            * We'll figure out how to write test cases that automatically verify that our app is working as expected
                - We'll be able to run those test cases and prevent bugs from getting into production with real user data
