# Intro to Redux
`~/Documents/dev/react/udemy/redux-practice`

[documentation for Redux](http://redux.js.org/)

* Redux is tough to teach
* It is an inherently complex topic
* The documentation is great but the ecosystem is rapidly changing
* It relies on packages on the side and these packages fall into favor and fall * out of favor rapidly

## Redux is just the beginning of the road
### On top of Redux you also have
* webpack
* Redux Router
* React Router
* Redux Promise
* Redux Thunk
* HotReloading
* And a lot more stuff just to get started
* Add ES6 syntax is also another hurdle to overcome

We will try to unravel the mystery of `What is Redux` but also address some of the parts of the ecosystem as well

## What Redux is and what it does for us
