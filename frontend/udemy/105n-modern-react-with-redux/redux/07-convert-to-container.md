# Implementation of Container Class

Rename `app.js` to `App.js`

`App.js`

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import BookList from '../containers/BookList';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <BookList />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

* We import BookList
* We instantiate BookList and render it to the page

Now we need to make sure BookList has a connection from Redux to get `state` into the BookList Component

### End goal
Our Application `state` has a `books` property (list of books), and we want to get that list of books to show up inside of our BookList Component (Container)

## Let's forge that connection
We will import and use the Library `React-Redux`

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux'; // add this line
```

Now that we have this `connect` function, let's make use of it

We will not **export** this class anymore as the `default` so change the code from this:

`export default class BookList extends Component {`

to this:

`class BookList extends Component {`

## Now the fun begins
Add this function to the bottom of `BookList.js`

```
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  
}
```

The purpose of this function is to take the Application `state` as an argument

**note** Our state contains the array of books and the active book

```
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // Whatever is returned will show up as props
  // inside of BookList
}
```

* We usually will return an object from `mapStateToProps()`

```
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // Whatever is returned will show up as props
  // inside of BookList
  return {
    
  }
}
```

Whatever is contained within this object is going to be set equal to `this.props` of our Component (BookList)

Example

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class BookList extends Component {
  renderList() {
    return this.props.books.map((book) => {
      return (
        <li key={book.title} className="list-group-item">{book.title}</li>
      )
    })
  }

  render() {
    console.log(this.props.asdf); // -> '123'
    return (
      <ul className="list-group col-sm-4">
        {this.renderList()}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // Whatever is returned will show up as props
  // inside of BookList
  return {
    asdf: '123'
  };
}
```

```
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // Whatever is returned will show up as props
  // inside of BookList
  return {
    books: state.books
  };
}
```

Above is our connection between Redux and our Component, (our Container)

## Now we need to make use of our `connect` function
The connect function says, take this Component, take this `mapStateToProps()` and return a `Container` and that Container is what we want to export from this file as well (that's why we deleted the export default above)

Whenever we make a Container file we don't want to export the plain "dumb Component", we want to export the "Smart Component" Container

`export default connect(mapStateToProps)(BookList);`

## Review
1. We imported our connect function from React Redux Library
    * React-Redux is the glue between React and Redux
    * They are completely different Libraries
    * They are not developed in tandem
    * Totally different libraries!
    * It is only through React-Redux that we get any kind of merging between the two of them
    * React-Redux makes `connect()` function available
2. `connect(function)(Component)`
  * Takes a function and a Component and produces a `Container`
  * The `Container` is a Component that is aware of the `state` that is contained by Redux
3. The `mapStateToProps()` function is important and key here
    * The first argument is the `state` and this function return an **object**
    * Whatever object is returned will be available to our Component as `this.props`

To repeat one more time The following function is the glue between React and Redux

```
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // Whatever is returned will show up as props
  // inside of BookList
  return {
    books: state.books
  };
}
```

We need access to `this.props.books` within our Component so we return so we return an object with a key of `books` and a value of `state.books`
* Because our BooksReducer is returning the property (our array of objects (which is an array of book titles)

## Two more important notes
### First important note
Whenever our Application `state` changes

* we are loading a list of books from some remote server
* or our user clicks on something and that changes the list of books
* or for whatever reason that our state changes
* This Container (BookList) will instantly re-render with a new list of books

### Second Import note
Whenever the Application `state` changes the object in the `state` function, will be assigned as `props` to the Component (in our case it will end up as `this.props.books`)
