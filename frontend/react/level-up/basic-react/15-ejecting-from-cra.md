# Ejecting from Create React app
* **note** Once you do this there is no going back
* This is to get control of webpack and add Sass or other custom configs
* If you look at `package.json` you will see it runs `react-scripts eject`
* Make a copy of your code so you can go back if you want
        - I will create a new branch called `eject`

`$ git checkout -b eject-cra`

## Time to eject
`$ npm run eject`

### Where to go next
* NextJS
    - server side rendering
