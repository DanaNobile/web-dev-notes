# Object Oriented Programming
* We use objects to model after real world things
    - note
    - person
    - car

## OOP focuses on code reusability
`oop.js`

```
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 55,
  getBio() {
    return `${this.firstName} is ${this.age}`;
  },
};

const bio = person.getBio();

console.log(bio); // 55
```

* But What if I want a second person?

## OOP is better
```
const person = new Person('John', 'Doe', 55);

const bio = person.getBio();

console.log(bio); // Person is not defined
```

* Above won't work until we define our Person
* But we can use this to reuse our code
* We have a lot less code
* The first way we have to redefine every time we want to create a person
* But with OOP we create a function that will act as a template to create people
    - We saw this with `new Date()`

### Calling multiple people
```
const husband = new Person('John', 'Doe', 55);
const wife = new Person('Jane', 'Doe', 50);

const husbandBio = husband.getBio();
const wifeBio = wife.getBio();

console.log(husbandBio);
console.log(wifeBio);
```

### Visualization

* When we make a new person from our function template we call that an `instance`
* All of our notes created are made of the same properties and methods
* All of our todos created are made up of the same properties and methods

## Our methods will be in the `Person Prototypes`

![prototypes](https://i.imgur.com/FXtCNox.png)

* Every person we create will have access to the same set of methods

![Person methods](https://i.imgur.com/iUqlmOT.png)

* These methods are going to work with the instance data

## A lot of this gets used internally by JavaScript

### Next - Constructor Functions
