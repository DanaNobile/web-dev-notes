# Modern React with Redux
![diagram](https://i.imgur.com/ymBnLqI.png)

## Start nice and easy
* No browser has complete support for ES6
* React and Redux are written in ES6

## Transpiling
* We can't use the code as it won't render properly in browser
* We need to take our ES6 code that can't be run in the browser and transpile it into something that can be read in the browser

## Tooling (Transpile JSX + ES6 to ES5)
* `Webpack` + `babel` create `bundle.js` (or application.js or... just one file with all our JavaScript inside it) takes our JSX and transpiles it into JavaScript that can be safely run inside of a browser
