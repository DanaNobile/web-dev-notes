# Final Deploy and Extras
* Kill server
* `$ git status`
* `$ git add .`

## We need to push our webhook to production and not to localtunnel
* SendGrid does not allow you to add multiple webhooks to use add addresses
* You need to set up a second account and set up webhooks on that as well
    - And point it to your live URL for heroku
* `$ heroku open`
