## idiomatic JavaScript
* Whenever we add a `constructor()` to our **class**, we're technically overriding our **classes**' default behavior
* Part of that default behavior is reassigning the `props` passed to our component back to the **React.Component** instance
* Using the ES2015/ES6 `super()` method, we can keep this functionality intact by passing the `props` we'd send by default back to **React.Component**
