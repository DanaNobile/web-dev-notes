# Passing Dynamic data with props
How do you get data from one Component into another Component?

Through `props`

## What are `props`?

`<img src="cloud.jpg" alt="A Cloudy Day">`

### Kinda like HTML attributes, yo!
In HTML elements have **attributes**. Attributes are extra properties on that particular element. In React, `props` work the same way.

In React if you want to pass information to a tag, you pass it via a `prop`

### Add a `tagline` prop to our Header Component
`src/components/App.js`

```
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Lineup from './Lineup';
import Roster from './Roster';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="team-of-the-day">
        <div className="menu">
          <Header tagline="Soccer Stars" />
        </div>
        <Lineup />
        <Roster />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App;
```

## Update the Header Component
```
import React from 'react';

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <header className="top">
        <h1>Soccer Stars</h1>
        <h3 className="tagline">Static Text Here</h3>
      </header>
    )
  }
}

export default Header;
```

Now we have our HTML and we have included our `tagline` prop but it has a static value that we will eventually make dynamic

## View in browser
You'll see `Soccer Stars` is styled and the `tagline` says `Static Text Here`

### View React tab in Dev Tools
You'll see Header has a tagline and on the right panel we see `Props` and `tagline: Soccer Stars` (_which is the value we gave `tagline` in `App.js`_)

**note** You can name your props whatever you want

All the attributes you give the Component, they are all all listed under `Props` in React tab of Dev tools

`<Header tagline="Soccer Stars" color="blue" hitpoints="100" />`

All the props we added are now listed under `Props`

## Update App.js
We are done playing with attributes. You get it. You can add as many props as you want. Remove them all and just keep tagline by updating our code to just have the following `prop`:

`<Header tagline="Soccer Stars" />`

### Accessing Prop Values from inside Component
```
import React from 'react';

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <header className="top">
        <h1>Soccer Stars</h1>
        <h3 className="tagline">{this.props.tagline}</h3>
      </header>
    )
  }
}

export default Header;
```

#### How do you put variables into JSX?
`{this.props.tagline}`

### Improve the tagline in Header.js
Wrap the tagline in a `span`

`<h3 className="tagline"><span>{this.props.tagline}</span></h3>`

#### What is `this.props`?

`this` will refer to the Component and `props` is an Object that we can use to gain access to all the `Props` available to it

## View in browser
You will now see our `h3` is populated by data we suplied to the `<Header>` component inside `App.js`. If you change the text for `tagline` in `App.js`, and save, the text will update with your change

### Let's talk about `this`

```
class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    console.log(this);
    return (
      <header className="top">
        <h1>Soccer Stars</h1>
        <h3 className="tagline">{this.props.tagline}</h3>
      </header>
    )
  }
}
```

* `this` when viewed in console will show you the `Header`. Expand and you'll see `props` and that it is an Object that has 3 items

**note** `this` is inside the `render()` method. This is an important thing to notice and understand because when we start creating custom methods inside this component, we will have to manually bind `this` to the component so we can use `this` inside our custom methods

## Debug Component in console with `$r`
1. Select Component in React tab of dev tools
2. Switch to console
3. Type `$r` in console and you'll see Component
4. Type `$r.props` and you'll see all the props on that Component

**Debug** Elements in Elements tab of dev tools with `$0`

1. Just select element you want to inspect
2. Switch to console tab 
3. Type `$0` and you can start debugging that element
4. Let's say you select a `<div class="menu">...</div>`
5. Then type `$0.classList` and you will see `["menu"]`

`Header.js`

## Add HTML to make our Heading look nicer
```
class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    console.log(this);
    return (
      <header className="top">
        <h1>
          Team
          <span className="of-the">
            <span className="of">of</span>
            <span className="the">the</span>
          </span>
          Day
        </h1>
        <h3 className="tagline"><span>{this.props.tagline}</span></h3>
      </header>
    )
  }
}
```
