# Section Intro: Using a Third-Party Component
* We are currently using the browser's built in `alert()` function and this is not a very good UX experience
* It looks bad
* We can't style it
* And it stops JavaScript from running in the background which is a huge problem

## Third Party Library
* There is a vast ecosystem of Third Party Library
* ReactModal is a Third party library
    - We will integrate ReactModal into our application
    - This will provide us with a component that makes it simple to use modals in our app

### Good news when using ReactModal
* We won't have to reinvent the wheel
* Everything we need to show/hide and manage our modals is built in
* We don't have to write all that code as it is not specific or unique to our app

## We will install ReactModal
* Once we install it once it will be the same process for any future project
* It will be the same process for any other third party library we want to use on future projects or this project
