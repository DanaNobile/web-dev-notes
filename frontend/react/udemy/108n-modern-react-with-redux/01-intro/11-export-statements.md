# Export Statements
* We will talk about three things:
    1. Exporting Modules
    2. Classes
    3. State

`SearchBar.js`

```
const SearchBar = () => {
  return <input />
}
```

## Important to `import` 
* Even though we are not making use of `React` inside this Component we still need to include it because we are using JSX

```
import React from 'react';

const SearchBar = () => {
  return <input />
}
```

**note** When we write JSX like `<input />` the transpile to Babel will be `React.createElement()` so you need to import `React`
    * If you don't believe me go [babel](https://babeljs.io/repl) and try it yourself

**important** `React` need to be imported into all of our Components when we write JSX

## Do something so that use can see it
* If we can get our `SearchBar` over and into `index.js` we can render it to the page

### Houston we have a problem
* To render the `SearchBar` Component, `index.js` needs a reference
* **note** All of our Components are **siloed** from each other unless we explicitly declare a connection between them
* We have learned how to **import** code but we have yet to learn how to **export** code 

## exporting code the ES6 way
* We only want to export a subset of our file so we write this at the bottom of `SearchBar.js`

```js
export default SearchBar;
```

* Now any file that **imports** `SearchBar` will get our `SearchBar` component

```
const SearchBar = () => {
  return <input />
}
```

* Complete `SearchBar.js`

```
import React from 'react';

const SearchBar = () => {
  return <input />
}

export default SearchBar;
```

* If we changed the export like this:

```
import React from 'react';

const SearchBar = () => {
  return <input />
}

const foo = 5;

export default foo;
```

* Then our export would be `5` and not our `SearchBar` Component
* Make sure to change it back to the way it was before we added `foo`

```
import React from 'react';

const SearchBar = () => {
  return <input />
}

export default SearchBar;
```

### Now import SearchBar into `index.js`
`index.js`

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import SearchBar from './components/SearchBar';

const API_KEY = 'AIzaSyC9bJsdEJpmtGcBb_c7ck0NvOvyShMxXXX'; // fake API

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar />
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('.container'));
```

* Make sure the path is correct
    - `import SearchBar from './components/SearchBar';`
    - Whenever we import code that we write we have to give an actual file reference to the file we are trying to import
    - We don't have to do that with Libraries we import (like `React`) because they are **namespaced**
        + We can only have one installed package called `React`
            * Go into the `node_modules` folder and get the directory called `react` (Same thing with `ReactDOM`)
    - So with your custom code inside your `React` app, make sure you import using relative paths from the file you are in to where the file is where you are importing it from
    - `./` This represents the **current directory**
    - You do not need `.js` suffix as long as it is a JavaScript file

### Multiline JSX
```
return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar />
    </div>
  )
```

**important** Have one parent tag for your JSX

### Tree of Components
* We are now starting to form a `tree of components`
* At the very top of the tree we have our `App` Component
* The first child inside of this tree is our `SearchBar` Component

## Test in browser
* You should see an input element on the screen
