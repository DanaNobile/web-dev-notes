# Front End Tech
![frontend tech diagram](https://i.imgur.com/6thULZx.png)

* Green boxes are backend
* Blue boxes are frontend

## Auth on Client
* Having the ability on our client whether our user is authenticated or not

## Tip
* As a full stack developer, work on frontend or backend at one time
* You will end up with spaghetti code if you work on them together

## Mockups
* `ourdomain.com/` - User sees this screen when they come to the root route of our application

### Surveys page
* when user visits ourdomain.com/surveys

### Create Survey Form

* SurveyForm
* SurveyField

## React Router
* We will use React Router to handle navigation inside our client

## Redux
* We want to load up resources
* We want to have a list of records and we want to fetch data
* And we want to persist that data when we navigate between different routes
* So Redux in our app seems appropriate
