# Stuff you need (setup)
**note** we are using yarn for installs but if you ever get an error installing with yarn just revert to installing with `npm` (the two are supposed to be the same but sometimes there are glitches -- currently I prefer to use yarn as it is faster)

* `node.js`
    - webpack needs this
    - > v8
    - install with brew
    - `$ node -v`
    - comes with npm (node package manager)
* npm
    - enables us to install project dependencies
* yarn
    - npm and yarn do same thing
    - `$ brew install yarn`
