| New Features for Blogging App
|-------------------------------

1. I should be able to delete other users comments if the comment is on my post. (If someone writes offensive things on my post I can delete it)
2. I should be able to disable comments on my post.
    (you want to prevent people from adding comments to your post) - add `commentsEnabled` as a boolean field on an individual post and then someone can configure when the create or update post
3. I should be able to have a pinned/featured post that I want to share. Add "featuredPost" field to user with "Post" type.
