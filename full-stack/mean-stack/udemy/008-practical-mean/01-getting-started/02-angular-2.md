# What is Angular 2?
* Angular is the counterpart of NodeJS that runs on the server
* Angular runs on the browser

## What is the purpose of Angular 2?
* To create a great user experience because as it runs in the browser it is able to provide a reactive user experience
    - We don't need to send a request and wait for a response
    - Everything happens instantly
    - Angular is written in JavaScript
        + We will use Typescript
            * The official language used for Angular 2
                - Typescript is just a superscript to JavaScript
                - It adds additional syntax
                - It makes the JavaScript syntax nicer
                - It adds extra checks
                - It adds extra features
                - In the end we will have a build process that converts our Typescript into ES5 because that is what runs in the browser

## Our Angular 2 App
* Single Page
* Updates DOM
* Handles Routing (of visual parts)
    - That is client side routes
    - We will also use some server side routes
        + Only to reach stuff in the backend
* Very reactive user experience
