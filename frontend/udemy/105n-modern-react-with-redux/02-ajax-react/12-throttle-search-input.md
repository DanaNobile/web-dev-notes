# Throttle Search input
To make use of throttling we will make use of a function library called `lodash`

## lodash
Contains a ton of different utility methods, one of which is called **debounce**

### debounce
Can be used to throttle how often a function is called

Best way to see how it works is with an example

## Install lodash
`$ npm install --save lodash`

## Import lodash into `index.js`

`index.js`

```
import _ from 'lodash'; // add this line
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import YTSearch from 'youtube-api-search';
import SearchBar from './components/SearchBar';
import VideoList from './components/VideoList';
import VideoDetail from './components/VideoDetail';
```

* You usually use a underscore `_` when importing **lodash**

In this code `<SearchBar onSearchTermChange={term => this.videoSearch(term)} />`

We only want to be calling this function `term => this.videoSearch(term)}` only once every n milliseconds

This is the place we want to throttle it and this is where we will place a **debounced** function down into `SearchBar`

```
render() {
    const videoSearch = _.debounce((term) => { this.videoSearch(term) }, 300);
    return (
      <div>
        <SearchBar onSearchTermChange={term => this.videoSearch(term)} />
        <VideoDetail video={this.state.selectedVideo} />
        <VideoList
          onVideoSelect={selectedVideo => this.setState({selectedVideo}) }
          videos={this.state.videos} />
      </div>
    );
  }
```

* We created a fat arrow function and we passed it to `_.debounce()`

`_.debounce((term) => { this.videoSearch(term) }, 300);`

#### What is `_.debounce()` function doing?
_.debounce() takes the inner function `this.videoSearch(term)` and it returns a new function that can only be called once every 300 milliseconds

We store that inside the `videoSearch` variable and then we pass that to `onSearchTermChange`

Now `SearchBar` can be called as often as it wants, it can call the `onSearchTermChange` callback all the time but no matter how many times it is called it will only run once every 300 milliseconds

## Save and Test
Refresh and see that now there is a slight wait after typing before the search of videos changes based on your term. Throttling makes our app appear to function faster and with less unnatural jarring. A better overall user experience

**note** Google instant search works like this
