* A video player modeled off of youtube
* Search bar will update video list
* They click on video and video will play
* No dummy data, we'll use the youtube API

## npm start
`$ yarn start`

* This will start up the boilerplate package and run the local server
* We write JavaScript inside of this package and `babel` and `webpack` bundle all those files together, convert them to ES5 (which can be ran inside the browser) and then makes a local server available from which we can view all those files

* Your terminal will show you that the entire [package is finished compiling](https://i.imgur.com/3qmPP7f.png)

## Navigate to default starter page
