# Intro JavaScript objects
* Objects allow us to store related pieces of information in a single value

## Note App
* What makes up a note?
    - A note is the combination of a `title` and a `body`
        + Both of those values are strings and when we store them together we have the **note** as a whole

## Model Users
* A user is nothing more than a combination of
    - A name,
    - An email,
    - A password
    - Age
    - Address
    - Phone
    - Anything else we could associate with a user

## Model things from the real world - example: Book
* Book has
    - Page count
    - Title
    - Author
    - Publisher

## With an object we can store all those pieces of information in one central location
