# Arrays Intro
* Arrays allow us to store a "list" of values
* The values can be numbers, strings, other arrays, objects... all JavaScript data types

## Different types of real word apps that use arrays
* Texts being sent back and forth
* Google maps shows a list of locations
* Click on location get a list of temperatures for that week
* Turn on TV and see list of all apps installed
* Click on Netflix and see a list of all of the shows available
* Lists are essential to any modern application
