# Deploy apps
* How to deploy our app to a production server

## 3 things we will accomplish
1. We will learn to work with `node.js` and the `Express` library that will set up a **production web server** that will `serve up` our **React app assets**
2. Understand how to configure `Webpack` for **Production**
    * This will
        - Reduce the bundle size
        - Speed up our app
3. Use the `Heroku deployment platform` to deploy our apps **live to a production server**
