# Why use node?
* Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
* Node.js package ecosystem, **npm**, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world

## What is I/O?
* Input/Output
    - This is the communication from your node app to other things inside the IOT (Internet of Things)
        + Database read/write request
        + Changing files on your file system
        + Making a HTTP request to a separate web server
