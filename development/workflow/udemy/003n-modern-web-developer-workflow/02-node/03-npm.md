# NPM
`N`ode
`P`ackage
`M`anager

## Install specific version (example... lodash)
`$ npm install lodash@4.17.4`

## Problems updating npm to latest version
* This is a problem and I've wasted time trying to solve it
* Here's the solution

`$ npm install npm@latest -g`

* I installed node via brew and it seemed to mess things up and then when I installed node globally it caused glitches
* The above solution got it to work
* Upgrading `$ brew upgrade npm` did not work

## What is NPM?
* Centralized place where developers share their code with the world
* Oh, and it's FREE!
* This saves us time
    - We don't have to reinvent the wheel
    - We can share code with each other
    - Create better stuff

## NPM is kinda like a Grocery Store
* Instead of food it contains code

### Time to Bake a cake
(_flour, sugar, vanilla extract, baking powder_)

#### How do we get those ingredients?
* Do we grow wheat and turn it into flower ourselves?
    - No. We go to grocery store and buy flour
* For our website we could go to the NPM (_the Code Store_) and get all the following web site ingredients for free!
    - jQuery
    - Picturefill
    - Auto compile CSS
    - Auto concat JS

### What is package management?
* And why would we use it?

#### This is why
* You may have to go to 3 stores for all your supplies
* Or you'd have to chrome search for and go to each individual site to get all this stuff... Google, jQuery, Bootstrap, Lightbox...

#### With Package management
* Create a grocery list (_aka code list_)
* Share list with your personal assistant robot
* Robot fetches all ingredients for you

#### Food can expire
* Code can become outdated/bugs
* The 3rd party developer fixes the bug or updates their code base after we already downloaded it and are using it in our site
* With package management we can run a single command and our robot will automatically grab all fresh copies of all our ingredients/code list
    - It will check every single ingredient and see if it expired and if so, it will grab the most recent code

## What types of files/packages are on NPM?
1. Node packages
    * Automation
    * Build tools
    * Server tasks
2. Other things
    * Have nothing to do with `Node`
        - jQuery
        - Lodash
        - Bootstrap
        - `Normalize.css`

## NPM is not just for node
* It can be our `one-stop-shop` for all code we need

## Demo
`$ npm install jquery`

* Created 
    - `node_modules` (_folder_)
    - `package.json` (_file_)

But we should first create `package.json` with `$ npm init -y`

### this creates our grocery list/code list
`package.json`

* You will create `package.json` for each of your projects

#### Add jQuery

`$ npm install jquery --save`

Or here is the short way of writing the same thing

`$ npm i jquery -S`

That will add `node_modules` with **jQuery** to our folder but also **jQuery** inside our `package.json`

#### Add Normalize.css

`$ npm i normalize.css -S`

### Backing up
That grocery list is great to have because if you delete `node_modules` you can easily remember all your ingredients and just use `$ npm install` to re-install all your packages

### How do I know what the exact name of the package is to install?
Google with a search like `npm THEPACKAGENAMEYOUARELOOKINGFOR`

### How do we actually use the package JS and CSS files that are inside `node_modules`?
* Do we manually move them outside of `node_modules` (_that would take a long time and it would suck_)
    - Leave the files inside of node_modules
    - We will learn elegant ways to import node_moduels code into our projects

### Why can't we see our new packages in `node_modules` when we `$ git status`?
* `.gitignore` - hides `node_modules`

### Why do we ignore node_modules?
* Best practice
* Not our code
* We don't want to add it to git/github/bitbucket

We just clone and use `$ npm install` to grab all our most recent packages

`$ git status`
`$ git add -A`
`$ git commit -m 'add jquery and normalize`
`$ git push origin master`
