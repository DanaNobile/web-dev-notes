# ES6 Promises
* enable us to do something after a long running task completes
    - long running task like setting data in the firebase DB

## create `promises.js` to experiment with promises
* Import it temporarily into app.js

`app.js`

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import 'normalize.css/normalize.css';
import AppRouter from './routers/AppRouter';
import configureStore from './store/configureStore';
import './styles/styles.scss';
import './firebase/firebase';
import './playground/promises';
// MORE CODE
```

`promises.js`

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('This is my resolved data');
});
```

* Above is a valid Promise
* We won't see code like this as it will live inside libraries we use (like firebase)
    - We will use Promises a lot
    - Promises that get generated by method calls like `set()`

## When we have a Promise how do we do something when is succeeds or fails?
* We have to access the Promise and register some callbacks
* `.then()` let's us register a callback
    - That callback will fire WHEN and IF that Promise **resolves**

```
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('This is my resolved data');
});

promise.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

* We see `This is my resolved data` in chrome console
* We will simulate time and lag using `setTimeout()`

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('This is my resolved data');
  }, 3000);
});

promise.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

* After 3 seconds you'll see `This is my resolved data`
