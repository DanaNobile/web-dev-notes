# JavaScript in the browser
* Use JavaScript in UI
* Now we can let users fill forms out and other great UI stuff

## What we will do
* Render a list of notes based off an array of notes we have in our JavaScript
* We'll learn how to respond to user interaction
    - An end user clicks on a button to remove a notes and we'll respond to that with some JavaScript code
    - We want to re-render that list with that item removed
    - If an end user submits a form to enter a new note we want to make sure that new note shows up

## Next - Set up a webserver
* This will allow us to serve up the new apps we'll be creating
