# Difference between Component instances and Component classes
* `ReactDOM` is used to interact with the actual DOM
* While `React` is used to create and manage our Components

## We still have an error. Why?
* When we create a Component we create a class of a Component
* A type of Component
* We currently have one Component `App`
* We could have many different intstances of `App`

```
const App = function () {
  return <div>Hello</div>;
}
```

* This is a **class**... Not an `instance`
* Think of the above function as a factory (also think of blueprint) where we pump out instances and render it to the DOM

### Making sense of our error
* Instead of passing a **component class**, make sure to `instantiate` it by passing it to `React.createElement()`
* We passed a **class** to `ReactDOM`, not an **instance**
    - And that was what caused the error

### Lesson learned
* We need to instantiate our Components before we try to render them to the DOM

[try it out](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&evaluate=true&lineWrap=false&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-2&targets=&browsers=&builtIns=false&code=%3Cdiv%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E)

* If you type: `<div></div>`
    - **note** Self closing elements or elements with no content should be written like `<div />`
* `babel` will transpile it to this:

```
"use strict";

React.createElement("div", null);
```

* So when we write JSX, and type the Component name `App`
* That Component name is a Component class, but using it inside of **JSX** turns it into a Component instance
* That is the connection between JSX:
    - A Component
    - And a Component instance

* So if you type this in babeljs.io:

```
const App = function () {
  return <div>Hello</div>;
}
// Take this Component's generated HTML and put it on the page (inside the DOM)
ReactDOM.render(<App />);
```

* You will get this in the output

```
"use strict";

var App = function App() {
  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    null,
    "Hello"
  );
};
// Take this Component's generated HTML and put it on the page (inside the DOM)
ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App, null));
```

* This means that typing `<App />` you are actually typing the **instance** of `App`
* The code passed an instance of `App` to `ReactDOM.render()`

### Test in browser
* The last error is gone but we have yet another error: `_registerComponent(...): Target container is not a DOM element`
