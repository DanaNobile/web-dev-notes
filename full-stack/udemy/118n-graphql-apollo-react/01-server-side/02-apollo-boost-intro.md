* `GraphQL` powers our API
* Apollo is what allows us to bring `GraphQL` into our app

## Within our app we'll have 2 parts
* Server
* Client

### Our [Server](https://www.apollographql.com/server)
* We'll have a `GraphQL` server
* We'll need `Apollo` packages for this

#### Packages we'll need for our server
* `Apollo Server`
    - This will enable us to build a `GraphQL` server
* `graphql` tools

### On our [Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
