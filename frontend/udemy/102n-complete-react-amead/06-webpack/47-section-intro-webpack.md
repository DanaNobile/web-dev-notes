# Section Intro - Webpack
## Tooling
* Webpack
    - Webpack is an asset bundler
        + It will combine all the assets that make up our application with all of the assets needed from 3rd party libraries
        + This will allow us to do a couple of exciting things:
            1. We can take advantage of 3rd party libraries in our project (date pickers and drag n drop)
            2. We can take our own application code and break it up into several files
                * Each component will live in its own files so our application is easier to manage
