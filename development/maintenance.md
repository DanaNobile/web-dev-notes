# Maintenance
* The following are instructions you need to follow to keep all your dev tools up to date

## Homebrew
* Check if you have any homebrew problems
* If all is good you will get `Your system is ready to brew.`

`$ brew doctor`

## You can install node via the online website or homebrew
* I like using homebrew to install node
* This puts it in a different location than the online install
* So when you get terminal messages to update node you need to update node

`$ brew update`

## Now upgrade node
`$ brew upgrade node`

* This will update node and also `npm`
* homebrew's version of node/npm might not be as current as node's online version
