# Intro Production Deployment
* Goal - get your app deployed to production

## Where we are now
* We have everything running on our machine
    - What do we have running?
        + Our Docker container running in Docker
        + Our Node.js running via the Terminal
* Now we need to get both of those running on a production server (so they can be accessible to the outside world)
    - This will:
        + Let others use our API
        + Enable us to create our own mobile and web clients for the GraphQL backend
