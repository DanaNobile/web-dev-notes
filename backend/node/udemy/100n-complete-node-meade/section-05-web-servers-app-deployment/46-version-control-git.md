# Version Control with Git
`$ git --version`

## init
`$ git init`

`$ ls -a`

Don't touch .git

## Which files do we track with git?
* view

### Don't track
* server.log
* node_modules (aka generated folder)

### First commit
`git commit -m 'initial commit'`

`.gitignore`

## Setting up github and ssh keys
* SSH keys were designed to securely communicate between two computers
* [link to speed up iterm by removing log
files](http://osxdaily.com/2014/04/30/speed-up-terminal-app-mac-osx/)

```
This moves all *.asl log files into the users Trash can, which can then be emptied manually:
sudo mv /private/var/log/asl/*.asl ~/.Trash

Meanwhile, the alternative is to use the rm command to delete the files directly:
sudo rm -i /private/var/log/asl/*.asl

The -i flag serves as a protection layer by confirming the file deletion, this
is helpful for those new to the terminal and to help prevent errors. If youâ€™re
comfortable with the command line and nuking the full directory contents, skip
the -i and use -rf instead.
```

## Do I have an existing SSH key?
* Default location of SSH keys

`$ ls -al ~/.ssh`

* after you generate a ssh key
* Use the github ssh key generator online tutorial
* `id_rsa` - this is the private key, you should never give this key to
anyone, it lives on your machine and your machine only
* `id_rsa.pub` - is the public file and the one you give to 3rd party services
like github and heroku

## Start up the SSH Agent and add this key so that it knows it exists
* We do this by running 2 commands

1. `$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`

* This will start up the SSH Agent program
* It will also print the process id (pid) to confirm it is indeed running

## Tell the SSH Agent where this file lives
`$ ssh-add`

* This takes the path to our private key file (which we have in
`~/.ssh/id_rsa`)
  - after you run the above you should get a message like "identity added"

## Configure Github

## Test if SSH keys are properly configured on github
`$ ssh -T git@github.com`

* You may get a question that authenticity can't be established but it's ok
because you want to connect to github so type `yes`
* It will welcome you and say github does not provide shell access
* If you see this you are now ready to push your code to github
* Pushed to n-5-6-middleware.git on github
