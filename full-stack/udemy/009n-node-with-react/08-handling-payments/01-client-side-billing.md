* Green is backend
* Blue is frontend

## Billing
* Accepting payments from our users
* Accepting credit cards
* Updating features on our site if the user paid us money

### Mockup
![surveys](https://i.imgur.com/JZybVet.png)

* User will be able to click to add credits
* They will be taken to some screen to enter their credit card details
* If they give us money.. say $5, then we'll give them 5 credits in return
* Every credit enables our user to send out one mass survey
* Our mockup has two surveys so that means the user used up two credits
* And when they send out a survey, we need to subtract a credit

## Billing
* Huge topic
