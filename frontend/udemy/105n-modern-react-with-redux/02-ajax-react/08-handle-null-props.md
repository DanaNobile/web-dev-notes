# Handle null props
We first need to import `VideoDetail` into our `App` Component

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import YTSearch from 'youtube-api-search';
import SearchBar from './components/SearchBar';
import VideoList from './components/VideoList';
import VideoDetail from './components/VideoDetail'; // add this line
```

And add it to our `App` Component `render()` function

```
render() {

    return (
      <div>
        <SearchBar />
        <VideoDetail />
        <VideoList videos={this.state.videos} />
      </div>
    );
  }
```

### Problem - We need a video to pass to `VideoDetail`
* Currently, we just have an array of videos without any ability to just select one out of the list

Just to see it is working let's pass in the first video using:

`<VideoDetail video={this.state.videos[0]} />`

### View in browser
Console error says `Cannot read property 'id' of undefined at new VideoDetail` (We also have a nastly looking 2nd error that is probably a result of the first error). Most likely if we fix the first error, we'll also fix the second error at the same time

#### What is the problem here?
When the `App` first renders, it runs the `App` **constructor()** function which initializes the `state` to be an empty array and then it kicks off the request to go and get some more videos

While still waiting for the request to the Youtube API to render a response, the `App` Component `render()` method still tries to render itself. It doesn't pause and say "Oh, I'm still waiting for data, I don't want to render myself yet", it just goes ahead and tries to render itself and at that time `this.state.videos` is still an empty array and when we try to access index 0 of videos `this.state.videos[0]` and so when we pass in `video=undefined` into VideoDetail Component

So then we go inside `VideoDetail` to see what is manifested when we pass it a value of `undefined` for **video**

`VideoDetail`

Here, **video** will be `undefined`

```
const VideoDetail = ({ video }) => {
```

And then when we try to called `const videoId = video.id.videoId;`

We will get the error `cannot read property 'id' of undefined`

## How do we deal with null values in React
You will run into issues like this all the time with React. React has no patience and it always wants to render instantly. It never wants to wait

## Add a check!
Some parent objects can't fetch information fast enough to satisfy the needs of a child object so to handle this case, we will add a check inside of our `VideoDetail` Component to make sure a video has been provided in the props before it attempts to render

`VideoDetail`

```
const VideoDetail = ({ video }) => {
  if (!video) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
```

* Now if no video is provided, we return Loading... in a div, it's a return statement so the other code inside this functional Component won't run, but if a video is provided, then we don't show `Loading...` and instead render the Component with the **video**

## View in browser
We see our large video with a title and a description. The CSS needs to be improved but we are well on our way to completing our app

### Problem and next challenge
We still can't select a video yet. We'll do that next
