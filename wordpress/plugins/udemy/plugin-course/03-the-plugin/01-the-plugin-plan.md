# The Plugin Plan
 1. What is the problem I'm trying to solve?
 *  I'd like to build a list of subscribers on my website
 *  Currently there are lots of plugins that can do this that require a third party service like MailChimp
 *  I don't want to rely on MailChimp
 *  The problem is there aren't any WordPress plugins, that I know of, that allow me to capture and store subscribers independent of a third party service
 *  I'd also like to reward subscribers with a reward when they opt-in, I can't find a plugin that does that either

2. What's the solution?
* The solution is a plugin that can capture new subscribers, independent of thierd party service like MailChimp, and reward those subscribers when they opt-in (confirm) their subscription

3. What will my plugin do?

Features:

- Create unlimited email lists
- Capture subscribers with custom forms using a Shortcode
- Double opt-in for confirming subscriptions
- User unsubscribe feature with a subscription manager
- Reward subscribers with an exclusive download when they opt-in
- Easily export subscribers to a CSV
- Easily import subscribers from a CSV
- Automatically email subscribers when they sign up an opt-in
