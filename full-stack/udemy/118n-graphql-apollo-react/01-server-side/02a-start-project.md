# Time to start our Project!

## What we are building
* Think cologne
* Fans of cologne want to share their favorites 
* We need a database that stores user info so they can log in and out
* A user can add colognes so these users will be tied to the logged in user
* Their password will be encrypted
* There will be simple `client-side` and `server-side` side validation
* The DB will be mongoDB
* Our frontend framework will be React
* Our router will be React Router

### Put your entire project inside a folder called:

`five-star-colognes`

## server
* Create a new folder in your project root

`$ mkdir server`

## Make your file a git repo
`$ git init`

### Add `.gitignore`
* You can have a `.gitignore` in any directory
* Let's place ours **in the root** of our project

* Create `.gitignore`

`$ touch .gitignore`

```

## Add README.md
* All apps should have a README.md file in the root of your app
* This is great for documentation and explains what your app is, how to use it and how to install it
* It is written in markdown

### Let's create our README

`README.md`

```
# 5 Star Cologne MERN App
* Clone this repo

## Install app dependencies
* In the root of the app

`$ npm i`

* In the `/server` of the app

`$ cd server && npm i`

* In the client of the app

`$ cd ../` (go back to root of your app)

`$ cd client && npm i`

## variables.env
* You need to create a variables.env
* This file is not on github and in order for you to connect to MongoDB and
authenticate you need to create this file

`variables.env`

```
MONGO_URI=put your mongo info here
SECRET=put your secret here
PORT=put your port here
```

## How to run app
* In the root of your app

`$ npm run dev`
```

## Add to staging with git
`$ git add -A`

## Commit with git
`$ git commit -m 'initialize repo`

## Use hub to create remote github repo
* If you don't have hub install it with: `$ brew install hub`

`$ hub create`

* You may need to add your github username and password
* You will need to create a free github account if you don't have one
* I recommend [connecting to Github using SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) as you won't have enter your username and password every time

## Push to github
`$ git push origin master`

* **tip** Add and commit as you make progress through your project
