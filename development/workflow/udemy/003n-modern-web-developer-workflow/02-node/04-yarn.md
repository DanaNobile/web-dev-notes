# Yarn
* Facebook developers created yarn for some shortcomings they found with npm
* You have to download it and intall it globally
* It uses a similar but slightly different syntax than npm
* It currently is faster than npm because it uses caching
* You can use it 99% as a substitute for npm (sometimes you will have to use npm as yarn doesn't work for some packages. This is rare but I've seen it happen)
* Here is a [30 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MT64gN5dqI) to get you up to speed on yarn

## Yarn install project dependencies
`$ yarn install`

## Yarn add packages
`$ yarn add normalize.css`

* It will automatically add it to `package.json`

## Yarn add dev dependendencies
`$ yarn add gulp -D`
