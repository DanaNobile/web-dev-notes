# Binding Action Creators
Action Creators is just a funtion that returns an action (aka object)

An `action` is just an **object** that flows through all of our different reducers

`reducers` can then use that `action` to produce a different value for a particular piece of `state`

## Goal
Give our user the ability to click on a book and see a detail containing more information that book

### Steps
1. Ensuring that clicking on a book will create an `Action Creator`

#### How we can make that happen
1. Define an `Action Creator` and we'll make sure that we'll call it whenever a book title is clicked on

Let's create the Action Creator first

`src/actions`

```js
function selectBook(book) {
  console.log('A book has been select:', book.title);  
}
```

* For now all of our Action Creators will be defined in this file

### Don't forget to `export`!
Because we want to make use of this Action Creator in other places inside of our Application

```js
export function selectBook(book) {
  console.log('A book has been select:', book.title);
}
```

## How do we test this?
Now we have our action and we just need to be able to call it whenever a user clicks on a book

### Can we use this technique?
1. Import it into the BookList Component
2. Call our action in an onClick handler

Sadly, that won't work. It is not that simple

Right now we just have a plain function
We need to ensure that the action that gets returned from it, ends up running through all of our `reducers`

So we can't just call this function and assume that this action is just going to show up in the right place

We have to make sure that our Action Creator is wired up to Redux

**remember when**
We created a connection between BookList and our `state` using this `connect()` function

```
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
```

That turned BookList from a Component into a `Container`

We will further connect this Component by **binding** the `selectBook()` action to this `BookList` Component

## Binding selectBook to BookList
Import our Action Creator

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { selectBook } from '../actions/selectBook'; // add this line
```

### import bindActionCreators from redux
This is a function to make sure that the action that is generated by the Action Creator flows through all the different `reducers`

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { selectBook } from '../actions/selectBook';
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'; // add this line
```

## mapDispatchToProps
Add this function and modify the final export line to include it as an argument

```
// Anything returned from this function will end up as props
// on the BookList container
function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    // Whenever selectBook is called, the result should be passed
    // to all of our reducers
  return bindActionCreators({ selectBook: selectBook }, dispatch)
}
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(BookList);
```

`bindActionCreators()` is saying, "_I know you are going to call `selectBook` (this is an Action Creator you are going to call at some time). Whenever it gets called, I want to make sure that the result of it flows through this `dispatch` function_".

This **dispatch** function is what takes all these actions and receives them (kind of like a funnel) and it spits them back out to all the different reducers in our Application

## mapDispatchToProps()
Notice how we are passing `bindActionCreators()` an object with a key of `selectBook` and a value of `selectBook`

Just the same as we did with `mapStateToProps` anything we returned ended up as `props` on our `Container`

The same exact thing for `mapDispatchToProps()` - Whatever is returned from this function is going to be available as `props` to our `Container`

So now inside of our `BookList` **Container** we can call `this.props.selectList` (specifically because of the `selectBook` key right here):

`{ selectBook: selectBook }`

And that will call our Action Creator

## Lastly, add an argument to our connect() function
```
// Anything returned from this function will end up as props
// on the BookList container
function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  // Whenever selectBook is called, the result should be passed
  // to all of our reducers
  return bindActionCreators({ selectBook: selectBook }, dispatch)
}

// Promote BookList form a Component to a Container - it needs to know about
// this new dispatch method, selectBook. Make it available
// as a prop
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(BookList);
```

### This is the most popular use case of this
We want to take some `state` and map it to our `Container` and we want to take an Action Creator and we want to make it available to be called inside of the `Container` as well

### Review this chunk of code one more time

`return bindActionCreators({ selectBook: selectBook }, dispatch);`

This is our Action Creator with the `bindActionCeators()` and the dispatch() method

The purpose here is `selectBook` is a totally plain function, nothing special about it. It returns a plain JavaScript object. If we just call it and we get the object back inside of our Component, we'd be sitting there like "alright I got this action, what in the world am I going to do with it. We have no idea what to do with it". The only part of our Application that actually cares about that action is the `reducers`

The purpose of bindActionCreators and dispatch is specifically to take what gets returned from selectBook and makes sure it flows through all of the reducers. That is the purpose of bindActionCreators and dispatch

## Next Challenge
We will make sure BookList can call this ActionCreator `selectBook`
