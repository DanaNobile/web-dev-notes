# Angular 2 and Components
![multiple components make up an Angular 2 app](https://i.imgur.com/b2dtNmY.png)

* Angular 2 uses components and is created from multiple components
* There will be a root component and all the others sit on that root component
    - We might also have a header, a sidebar... all components
    - Each component is a contained piece of code, which contains a template with some HTML code which will be displayed in the client (browser) but also a `Class` which holds the logic of this component
    - The `Class` which holds the logic is hooked up to the template (which holds the HTML code) and this is done via **Data binding**
    - Each component has a Lifecycle
        + Angular 2:
            * Creates it
            * Updates it
            * Destroys it
