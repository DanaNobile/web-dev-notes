# Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

## Productivity
### MacOS
* I have the mac doc hidden by default but if I move my mouse to the bottom of the page, it appears
* Sometimes it appears when I don't want it to and I would have to manually make it disappear and it takes my hands away from the keyboard and slows down my workflow
* The `cmd` + `opt` + `D` keyboard shortcut will show/hide it
