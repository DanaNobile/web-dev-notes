# Understanding Components
* Everything in React is a Component

## What is a Component?
* A reusable piece of your website

### Think of tags in HTML
* **React** lets you build your own tags and you can put information inside these tags and these two things together is a `Component`

### Benefit of using Components
* Team members can just work on one Component 

## Parent Component
* The main parent Component is the `App` Component
* This is not always but it is a common name for the main Component

## What is `state`
* All our Components will pull on the same data and any time that data changes all the Components that pull on it will update simultaneously
