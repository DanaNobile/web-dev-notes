# React Router
## How it works
Render out the `router` to the page and then it will dictate which Components render based on routes in URL

### Import our Components
`Main.js`

```
// import components
import Main from './components/Main';
import Single from './components/Single';
import PhotoGrid from './components/PhotoGrid';
```

### Import Dependencies we need from React Router
* Router
* Route
* IndexRoute
* browserHistory

```
// import react router deps
import { Router, Route, IndexRoute, browserHistory } from 'react-router';
```

**note** We are just using `browserHistory` temporarily

* We will eventually put `Redux` into that `browserHistory`

## Change our render to point to `router`

**tip** Rendering multiple lines of JSX use parenthesees

```
const router = (
 // JSX here!
)
```

**note** The `router` in `React` is also a Component!

### This allows us to do HTML5 push state
```
const router = (
  <Router history={browserHistory}>
    
  </Router>
)
```

## Point our home page to the Main app
```
<Route path="/" component={Main}>

</Route>
```

At the very top level of our app, use the `Main` Component

## How our app will work
`Main` will always be visible in our app but nested inside it will either be our `Single` component or our `PhotoGrid` component

### How can we tell our router to route this way? 
Through nesting routes

### Nesting routes
```
<Route path="/" component={Main}>
  <IndexRoute component={PhotoGrid}></IndexRoute>
  <Route path="/view/:postId" component={Single}></Route>
</Route>
```

* If we are on the home `/` route, show the `Main` and `PhotoGrid` Components
* If we are on `/view/:postId` route, show `Main` and `Single` Components

**note** `PhotoGrid` and `Single` are **children** of the `Main` Component

That is why inside our `Main` Component we used the `this.props.children` and passed it `this.props`

`Main.js`

```
class Main extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>
          <Link to="/">Reduxstagram</Link>
        </h1>
        {React.cloneElement(this.props.children, this.props)}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

If we view our app in the browser we will have an error but if we change to point our render to `router` inside of `<Main />`, the error will disappear

```
const Main = React.createClass({
import React from 'react';

import { render } from 'react-dom';

// import css
import css from './styles/style.styl';

// import components
import Main from './components/Main';
import Single from './components/Single';
import PhotoGrid from './components/PhotoGrid';

// import react router deps
import { Router, Route, IndexRoute, browserHistory } from 'react-router';

const router = (
  <Router history={browserHistory}>
    <Route path="/" component={Main}>
      <IndexRoute component={PhotoGrid}></IndexRoute>
      <Route path="/view/:postId" component={Single}></Route>
    </Route>
  </Router>
)

render(router, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## View in browser
Error is gone and our app is working

### View React tab
* You will see `Router` is works
* You will see `Main` Component and on home page you will also see `PhotoGrid` Component
* If you go to a **URL** with something like this (_it matches our router pattern for the `Single` Component_) `http://localhost:7770/view/34234234`, you will see the `Main` and `Single` Components
* If you dive into the `React` inspector and highlight `Single` Component then hit the back button and switch back and forward buttons you will see how fast react changes the **DOM** by swapping out the Components necessary to match the `router`. How cool is that?!

## HTML5 push state
Is in charge of swapping this out, and it does it without a page refresh!
