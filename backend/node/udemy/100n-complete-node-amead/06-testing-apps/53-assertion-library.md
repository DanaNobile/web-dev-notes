# Using an Assertion Library
* Will help streamline our test code
* Help us make assertions about the value whether it is:
    - about their type
    - the value itself
    - whether an array contains an element
* We wrote an if statement and threw an erro
* our assertion library will write this code for us

## Expect
* [documenation](https://github.com/mjackson/expect)
* The assertion library we'll be using
* It is now jest and run by facebook

### Install inspect
`$ yarn add expect@1.20.2 -D`

### Load expect into our code
* Use the documentation to make assertions
