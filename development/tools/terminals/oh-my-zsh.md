## Where is the ZSH_CUSTOM folder located?
By default, it is at `$ZSH/custom`; that is, the custom directory under your oh-my-zsh installation, which is at `~/.oh-my-zsh` by default.

If you want to use a different location, you can set $ZSH_CUSTOM to a different path in your `~/.zshrc` before loading **oh-my-zsh**.

or use

`$ echo $ZSH_CUSTOM`
