# Setting up 404
* Check what happens when you visit a non existent client side route
    - Like `/not/a/page`
    - Notice after visiting the page you don't get an error and just a white page - We need to show a 404 page here
* React Router runs through our 4 routes looking for a match
    - It doesn't find any
    - So no components show up because there is no match so we just get a blank page in the browser
    - Look at the Elements tab in the Chrome console and you'll see just `<div id="root"></div>` and that is why it is empty

* We will try to render a component on pages that we haven't specified elsewhere - kind of like a "else" that renders when no matches are found

## Create our 404 component
`app.js`

```
// MORE CODE
const NotFoundPage = () => <div>404!</div>;

const routes = (
  <Router>
    <Route path="/" component={ExpenseDashboardPage} exact />
    <Route path="/create" component={AddExpensePage} />
    <Route path="/edit" component={EditExpensePage} />
    <Route path="/help" component={HelpPage} />
  </Router>
);
ReactDOM.render(routes, document.getElementById('root'));
```

* **note** The `path` prop is completely optional!

```
// MORE CODE
const NotFoundPage = () => <div>404!</div>;

const routes = (
  <Router>
    <Route path="/" component={ExpenseDashboardPage} exact />
    <Route path="/create" component={AddExpensePage} />
    <Route path="/edit" component={EditExpensePage} />
    <Route path="/help" component={HelpPage} />
    <Route component={NotFoundPage} />
  </Router>
);
ReactDOM.render(routes, document.getElementById('root'));
```

* That works but 404 is now showing up on every page along with other components but pages that don't exist we just see the 404
* This kind of works but we need to improve it
* **note** When we remove the `path` prop react router will always consider that a match

### A Solution!
* We only want to show `NotFoundPage` when the path doesn't match any of our other routes
* Solution: Use `Switch`

## Switch prop
* [Switch docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/api/Switch)
* Switch doesn't take any props and it easy to use
* React Router will move through your routes in order and **stop** when it finds a match and stop (so if it finds a match it goes no further)
    - This will prevent us from seeing `NotFoundPage` when we get a match
* We set our 404 route at the bottom as a catch all

`app.js`

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom'; // add Switch!

// MORE CODE

const NotFoundPage = () => <div>404!</div>;

const routes = (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/" component={ExpenseDashboardPage} exact={true} />
      <Route path="/create" component={AddExpensePage} />
      <Route path="/edit" component={EditExpensePage} />
      <Route path="/help" component={HelpPage} />
      <Route component={NotFoundPage} />
    </Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
ReactDOM.render(routes, document.getElementById('root'));
```

* Now anytime someone browses to a route not defined will get the 404 page

## Next - Link between pages
