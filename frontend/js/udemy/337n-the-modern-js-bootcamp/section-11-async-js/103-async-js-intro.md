## Asynchronous programming & HTTP quests with JavaScript
* This will enable you to connect your JavaScript apps to the outside world
* To send and receive dynamic data

## How did we get data into our apps thus far?
1. Hard coding it
    * Example: the hangman puzzle
        - We have the value typed directly into a JavaScript file
2. Getting it from the user
    * Example: todo text
        - The user types in and then submits

## The third way to get data into our apps
3. Sending and receiving data from a server

* We will be able to fetch a new, unique randomly generated puzzle for each and every instance of the hangman game
