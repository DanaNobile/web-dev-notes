* Should we remove nuvolomeetingcesar.mp4 from Dropbox?
* Should we also remove cesarnuvolochatsmallvideo.mp4
* Both do not have client sound on

# Okta with Nuvolu
* This video has not sound from Jason Siegrist (only from Cesar)
* I suggest removing this video as it is almost impossible to learn from

## Members
* Cesar Matias
* Jason Siegrist

## Content
* When an update happens from organization Okta will detect it
* For users that are existing today (laura) it will match her account up
* And we'll use Okta just for that purpose of importing and creating those users

### Automation
* You can configure it so that you no longer have to wait for an import from that service or application
