# Teaching notes
## Look, walk, grab, throw
(_essential with a large class_)

### work asynchronously
* Take a student that has it working to help another student, give 15 min time and I'll be back to help if you are still stuck
* Rinse and repeat - mobilize another student
* Tell stronger students that explaining code to others reinforces what they know and makes them stronger coders
* Spot weaker students and permenantly move them next to stronger students
ask stronger student (aside) if ok to do this
check back to see if stronger student is helping if not move again

## Make announcements that will save time and help all
if you spot something that could be common problem others will have, make
an announcement to class to save you having to tell all students

## 1 on 1
* What have you done so far?
* Can you articulate the problem?
* Let students talk it out
* #1 technique point to area where error is and ask the student what are we missing over here? What can we improve? What error will this cause?
This helps you understand what is going on in the students head
* Don't give answers have the student "fill in the blank"
* If the student is listening they are not thinking, get them thinking
* Let the students make mistakes so they can fix it themselves and build confidence in their troubleshooting techniques

## Have the student pseudocode
* They need to write their thoughts out in plain english
* Use comments

## Get students to use previous code
* So they get in good habit of saving code and referencing it for the future
* Let student know that all programmers revert back to:
    - Previous code
    - Coding demos
    - Previous homeworks
* The students will get used to doing this and it will save time in the future

## Compliment your student often!
* Vary you compliments so you let the student know you are listening
* On front end always have your console open when coding JavaScript
* html/css elements tab
* Node terminal open
* Always looking for errors through console logs
* Look on styles being used when clicking on elements
* Doc console on the bottom
* Format code - indent it, helps with debugging a lot
* Folders expand and collapse
* Tell them to develop good habits, save code often, check in browser
* Give the students context as to why they need to be doing these things

## next steps
* Never leave a meeting without establishing next steps
* Put pressure on student, 'nice' deadline, I'll be back in 15 min, I'm hoping to see this done and this is what I'm expecting to see you do

## How to use Google to help solve a problem
* Troubleshooting, memorizing, stackoverflow, github issues, blog posts
* Students think googling is cheating, kill that misconception
* Don't ever say 'just google it' evangelize the process and at the beginning walk students through the process
* Googling smart is a skill
* You’ll find that sometimes you know the answer, and sometimes you don’t

## ask student for recap
* line-by-line
* They need to understand every single line

## Quickly kill irrelevent questions to keep the student on track
* Never say all good, say explain the code to me

## Time is important
* Make the student work every second!

## Avoid helping students during instructor demos, if you do the student will fall behind
* Tell student I'll help you after class, during office hours

### Useful tools
* html validator
* code diff
* css validator
* code beautify
* Use slack to communicate directly with a student
* Have them commit their code to github and send you the link
provide a resource
* schedule hangouts but let them know time is limited but happy to cover fundamental concepts to help them build confidence and be self sufficient

### Success Manager dialog
if you find a student not responding or has issues, talk to the student success manager
