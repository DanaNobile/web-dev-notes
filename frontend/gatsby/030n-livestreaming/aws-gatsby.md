* NAWS - org to make development better for front end developers
* Help front end developers to build full stack apps (help them move further up the stack and help them take advantage of managed services like Hosting, authentication and GraphQL API service AppSync

* Think of it as a Rails for serverless apps
* You can create and manage your services directly from your command line
    - kind of like focus to frontend developers

## Install aws amplify
`$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

### Then run just amplify
`$ amplify`
