# Eject Create React App
* You can eject from create react app
* Once you eject you can not go back

## Let's eject
* We'll do so in a branch so that we can jump back to create react app

`$ npm run eject`

* It will ask you a question:

`Are you sure you want to eject? This action is permanent. (y/N)`

* Type `y` and press `return`

## What happens
* It gets rid of the training wheels
* All the stuff Facebook does for you it no longer does
* We now have a `config` folder
    - paths.js
    - env.js
    - dev an prod webpack configs
    - webpackDevServer config
* Our build commands still work as they did before

## Where to go next
* next.js
    - server side rendering
    - routing is super easy
* gatsby
